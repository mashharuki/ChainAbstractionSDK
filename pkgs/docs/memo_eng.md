# Chain Abstraction SDK

## Overview of Chain Abstraction SDK

The Chain Abstraction SDK is a product designed to revolutionize the current Web3 landscape, characterized by a proliferation of blockchain protocols.

This SDK aims to provide a unified interface for handling various Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) chains, lowering the barriers for new chains to enter the market and enabling application developers to seamlessly continue development without worrying about choosing the right chain.

The Chain Abstraction SDK that is abstracted one step further to aim to leverage ZetaChain, INTMAX Wallet SDK, and MetaTransaction to make blockchain application development significantly easier!!

## Challenges to Address

1. Complexity Due to Chain Diversity  
   Currently, there are multiple L1 and L2 chains, each with different protocols and rules.
   As a result, application developers need to implement and handle errors differently for each chain, complicating the development process.

2. Barriers for Emerging Chains  
   It is extremely challenging for new chains to provide the same level of documentation, implementation examples, and support from multiple applications as established chains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon), resulting in fewer opportunities for adoption.

3. Difficulty in Choosing Chains  
   Application developers often face unclear criteria for selecting which chain to use, leading them to rely on economic reasons (e.g., obtaining grants) to make their decision.

## Features Provided by the SDK

1. Unified Interface:  
   The SDK abstracts various blockchain protocols, offering a unified interface that allows developers to build applications without worrying about the specifics of each chain.

2. Simplified Gas Fee Management:  
   The SDK simplifies the management of gas fees, which vary between chains, enabling developers to use it without concern.

3. ZetaChain Integration:  
   The SDK provides features for seamless integration of multiple chains, facilitating smooth data exchange between them.

4. INTMAX Wallet SDK:  
   The SDK offers secure and efficient wallet management, enhancing the user experience.

5. MetaTransaction Support:  
   By supporting MetaTransactions, the SDK allows users to perform transactions without worrying about gas fees.

## Roadmap Proposal

1. Wave 1
   Formulate ideas and concepts.

2. Wave 2 to 4  
   Conduct integration experiments with related technologies (ZetaChain, INTMAX Wallet SDK, MetaTransaction).

3. Wave 5 to 10  
   Develop the MVP. Build a demo application that implements the minimal features to meet the product concept.

## Features to Implement in the MVP

- Functionality to create wallets from the frontend.
- Ability to manage assets on Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- Ability to call smart contract functions.
- Achieving the above in a UI that abstracts away the existence of blockchain.
